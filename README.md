# FantasyAuction

A bare-bones web application for drafting players in fantasy football auction.

The data is provided from an aggregated list of player rankings and maximum auction values from [FantasyPros](https://www.fantasypros.com) (scraped using the excellent [Html Agility Pack](http://html-agility-pack.net) library.) This data is exposed via a single endpoint as a locally-running web service.

The user interface is powered with [React](https://www.reactjs.org).
